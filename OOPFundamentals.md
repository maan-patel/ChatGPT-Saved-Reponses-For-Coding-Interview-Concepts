# Fundamental Concepts of OOP

## Objects

In OOP, an object is a self-contained entity that consists of both data and behavior. An object represents a real-world entity, such as a person, a car, or a bank account.

## Classes

A class is a template or blueprint that defines the characteristics of an object. A class specifies the data (attributes) and behavior (methods) that an object can have.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of combining data and behavior into a single entity (an object). Encapsulation helps to hide the implementation details of an object from the outside world, which promotes modularity and maintainability.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit characteristics from a parent class. A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass (or derived class). The class from which the subclass inherits is called the superclass (or base class). Inheritance allows a subclass to reuse the data and behavior of the superclass, and also allows for specialization through the addition of new data and behavior.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. There are two types of polymorphism:

1. **Overriding**: This occurs when a subclass redefines a method of the superclass.
2. **Overloading**: This occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
