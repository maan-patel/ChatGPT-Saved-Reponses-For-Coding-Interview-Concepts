# Dynamic Programming 
is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems in an array or table, so that they can be reused (rather than recomputed) when needed.

Here is a simple example of how dynamic programming can be used to solve the Fibonacci sequence problem:

```javascript
// Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

function fibonacci(n) {
  // Initialize an array to store the Fibonacci sequence
  let fib = [];

  // Base case: f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1
  fib[0] = 0;
  fib[1] = 1;

  // Iterate through the sequence and store the results in an array
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
  }

  // Return the nth element of the Fibonacci sequence
  return fib[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(6)); // Output: 8
```
In this example, we use an array to store the intermediate results of the Fibonacci sequence, rather than recomputing them each time they are needed. This allows us to achieve a significant speedup in the computation, especially for larger values of n.
